        We drop the 'XSection' column after extracting its values because these cross-section
        values will be used as "sample weights" during model training. In Monte Carlo simulations,
        the cross-section value represents the probability of a particular process occurring, and therefore

        as sample weights, we ensure that events with higher cross-section (and thus higher likelihood of occurrence) are
        given more influence during training. This helps the model to better represent the real-world distribution of events
        observed in the experiment, preventing the model from being biased towards simulated events that might be over- or

Model is built using hyperparameters that were previously optimized through a hyperparameter
optimization process. The goal of this optimization was to find the best values for parameters
such as learning rate, regularization strength, and activation functions that maximize the model's
performance. By using these pre-optimized hyperparameters, we ensure that the model starts from a
strong configuration, avoiding the need for extensive manual tuning. The model architecture consists
of multiple fully connected layers with L2 regularization to prevent overfitting, and a LeakyReLU
activation in the input layer to avoid vanishing gradient issues. The output layer uses a sigmoid

We are evaluating the performance of the model based on both the training and

is performing, with lower loss indicating better performance. In particular, we
are using binary cross-entropy loss since our task involves a binary classification 
problemâ€”distinguishing signal from background events in the ATLAS 13 TeV dataset. Similarly, 
accuracy metrics show how well the model is classifying events correctly. By comparing the 
training and validation loss and accuracy, we can check if the model is overfitting (i.e., performing
well on training data but poorly on validation data) or if it is generalizing well.
The loss and accuracy are tracked over each epoch of training, and we plot the results 
to visualize the model's performance. A good model should ideally show a decreasing trend in
loss and increasing accuracy, while the gap between training and validation performance should remain
small, indicating a good generalization.

The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is an important tool in particle physics 
for evaluating the trade-off between true positive rate (signal efficiency) and false positive 
rate (background misclassification). In high-energy physics, it's crucial to balance these factors 
to detect rare signals without falsely identifying too many background events as signal. 
The Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the ROC curve gives a single metric of how well the model performsâ€”an AUC 
closer to 1 indicates excellent classification performance.

how many of the actual signal events were correctly identified. By plotting this curve, 
we can understand the trade-off between these two metrics and ensure the model is making 
reliable predictions for signal events.
